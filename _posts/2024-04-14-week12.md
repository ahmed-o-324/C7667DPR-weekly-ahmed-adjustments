#Week 12

For this weeks discussion with Christopher Snider, I thought it was really fascinating, both the challenges and accomplishements done by Tidepool. A very eye opening element to this that I hadn't considered until the meeting was how Tidepool does not neccisarely have any open source 'competitors' per se, but is rather competing with the entire propriatary industry. It is interesting how these seperate entities have similar final goals in their attempts to make for more accesible and smart glucose monitoring systems, but the process in which they go about this poses significant opposing considerations, as the development of an open source model in many ways needs to embrace the things that propriatary softwares avoid (ie. pooling open customer data, giving out their software for third party develpoment).

Our group has begun attempting to fix the issues assigned to us in MuseScore. The first documentation related issue we have looked at was finally marked resolved. We're utilizing certain keyword sorting tools within terminal to better utilize how we go about finding the root cause of issues in the MuseScore source code. Because it has a significant number of files, directories, and would pose a significant challenge to understand how the entire code works. This has lent a much more concise amount of files to look through.
