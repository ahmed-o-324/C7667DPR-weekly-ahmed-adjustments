#Week 13

For this weeks discussion on 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar', I personally felt as though the lesson: "good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite", was one of the most important discussed by Raymond. This seems especially important due to its implications not only how open source can help workflow and how software gets developed, but how these methods can fix existing software. This is because the added transparency brought about by this model provides significant exposure to every aspect of a code, making it harder for program developers to hide poor quality code, while also laying out clearly what existing code needs significant changes. This is further aided by the step from innersource to open source, when your customer base can serve as an additional eye to perforamance improvements in code.

Having now switched from MuseScore to Oppia, we have had a much easier time getting started to contribute. This is not only because of the general framework in which Oppia subscribes to, which is requiring a potential code change and where in the codebase that would be, but they also cater a little better to laying out the entirity of their codebase and getting beginner contributors like us. Going forward, we are now getting assigned issues that we have begun working on this week, and plan to continue doing so when meeting today.
